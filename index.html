      <h1>My path to design</h1>
      <b>The foundation-</b> As a kid, I was fascinated by the themed layouts people were able to create on social media sites. Learning how to use Photoshop and write HTML/CSS became my fav hobby!<br><br>
      <b>Getting sidetracked-</b> Fast forward to college; I graduated with a Finance concentration and spent 4 years doing successful work (mutual funds & high-net-worth client portfolio reporting) in that field. Still, something kept reminding me of the fun I had being <i>creative</i>.<br><br>
      <b>The start of something new-</b> 2018 was the year I learned of UX design and redirected my career path. I engaged in a 9 month UX bootcamp where I learned the foundational ins-and-outs of the field, worked on a paid freelance project, and attended multiple UX meetups in my area. I am happy to say that I am able to utilize both my business experience as well as my creative mindset to design products that help companies improve their payment + reporting capabilities.<br><br>
      <b>TLDR-</b> I learned Photoshop, HTML, and CSS as a kid and was obsessed. Ended up getting a Finance degree, but changed my career to UX design after 4 years. I am now a full-time product designer creating scalable payment + reporting tools!<br><br>
      <b>fun fact-</b> I was a food instagrammer for a bit and was over the moon when I was invited to a Salt & Straw media tasting.
