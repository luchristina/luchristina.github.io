          <p><b>The problem</b> This client saw an opportunity to join the cloud storage market but was unsure which direction they wanted to take their new product. I was given the ability to idealize a cloud storage platform that could be successful in this market. This is a mock project given by Bloc.</p><br>
          <p><b>The goal</b> Storage is something people always find themselves short of, whether it's home storage or computer storage. In order to solve both, I designed a document storage platform aimed to help people reduce paper-filing.</p>

          <p><b>Analysis</b> After going through numerous iterations, I've moved forward from the bad style guides, poor usability, and experiment with a dark mode in order to produce this updated layout. The updated design reflects an airy and bright feeling. Everything is spaced out well to prevent the screens from looking cluttered. I also spent additional time on the placement of action items, thus, creating a more effortless experience.</p>

        <h2>Task: Upload a file.</h2>
        <p>
          After performing this usability test I noticed the bounce rate was pretty high. The biggest issue was that one user clicked around a lot but never successfully clicked the "Upload" link.</p>

        <br>
        <p><b>Analysis</b> One tester seemed to have a difficult time finding the 'Upload' link even though it was a large colored font. After analyzing this issue, it seems like there wasn't much visual hierarchy on that column. </span> <span class="left">I decided to make the font smaller in order to fix the visual hierarchy. I also swapped out the user's name for a header called "Actions". In order to highlight this column some more, the action links have nice blue to differentiate it from the folder and file links.</p><br><br>

            <p><b>Overall</b> It took many iterations to refine the brand of Archive. The usability tests made me realize that visual hierarchy is important. Additionally, what may look obvious to me may not be obvious to a user. </p><br>

            <p><b>What I would've done differently</b> I always think "The more research the better". I would have loved to interview more students and homemakers to get a better perspective on their day-to-day lives.</p><br>

            <p>
              <b>If I had more time</b>
              I would spend more time working on the document viewer screens to increase usability rates. This would include additional actions that would not require going back to the dashboard.
